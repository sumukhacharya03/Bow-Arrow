# Bow-Arrow
This is the result of me playing around with Three.js using html and JavaScript

# About the Project

This is a simple Bow and Arrow Simulation built using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. The simulation allows users to pull back a bowstring and release an arrow to hit a target. The bowstring stretches when pulled and releases the arrow realistically, after which the arrow moves independently toward the target. The target consists of multiple layers, and I have made sure the arrow hits a random layer on each attempt. The simulation also includes a reset feature to restart the game anytime.
